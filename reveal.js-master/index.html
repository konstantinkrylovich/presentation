							So let a look what is document oriented database, and we do this by comparing relation database and mongodb.
							Any relational database has a typical schema design that shows number of tables and the relationship between
							these tables. While in MongoDB, there is no concept of relationship. The following table shows the relationship
							of RDBMS(relational) terminology with MongoDB.

						That's a little concrete example of what a document might look in MongoDB, like I said, no real schema is
						enforced in MongoDB at all, you can have different fields in every document if you want, but obviously it is not a
						good idea. Documents (i.e. objects) correspond to native data types in many programming languages. Embedded
						documents and arrays reduce need for expensive joins. Dynamic schema of the document supports fluent polymorphism.
						This is an advantage that, all necessary information is stored in one document and you may do just one request to
						get it (this is called locality).But it is also a disadvantage. When we need to choose a small set of fields, for
						example, or change a single field, we have to read the entire document, that may lead to the spending of a large
						number of operations

							MongoDB supports dynamic queries on documents using a document-based query
							language that's nearly as powerful as SQL. You donâ€™t need to know sql and all this stuff. Also MongoDb has such
							features as Data Aggregation, Text Search and Geospatial Queries. But keep in mind you still can't do efficient
							joins and can't deal with normalized data very efficiently. And one more point is transactions and consistency
							(ACID).the MongoDB documentation says : "Mongo support ACID transactions".
							In real it doesn't support ACID, but support other minimum non-transactional guarantees.

						<h2>Replication</h2>
						<img src="assets/images/replica.png" alt="opensource dbs">
						<aside class="notes">
							MongoDB has a single master architecture. The idea being that we want to have consistency over availability. But
							you can have these secondary databases that maintain copies over time from your primary database so as writes
							happen to your primary database. Those writes get replicated through an operation log to any secondary nodes that
							you might have attached to it.
							MongoDB will automatically replicate those operations to those secondaries, so when the primary goes down one of
							these secondaries can take its place at the right way that replication chain works.

					<section data-background-color="#ffe599">
						<h2>Sharding</h2>
						<img src="assets/images/sharding.png" alt="opensource dbs">
						<aside class="notes">
							MongoDB provides horizontal scalability as part of its core functionality. Sharding distributes data across a
							cluster of machines. The way sharding works is that we actually have multiple replica sets where each replica set
							is responsible for some range of values on some indexed value in the database. So when you get starting to work
							it requires that you set up an index on some unique value on your collection and that index is used to actually
							balance the load of information among multiple replicas sets and then on each application server.
							MongoDB supports many indices although you're still discouraged from doing more than two or three in a given
							collection and you can only have one that's used for sharding but you can actually set up things like full-text
							indices for doing efficient text searches across MongoDB.
